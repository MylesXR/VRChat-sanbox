# FaxPartyPopper

Pick it up, click to pop.ðŸŽ‰

## Requirements
- VRChat SDK - World 3.1.10
- UdonSharp 1.1.6

## Installation
1. Import the `.unitypackage`
2. Open the `FaxPartyPopper` folder, drag `FaxPartyPopper.prefab` into your scene.
3. Tweak the prefab's components (if you want to).

## Advanced use
- Tweak the `Fax Party Popper U# Script` component to change:
    - The number of particles emitted.
    - Audio pitch randomization.
    - Cooldown between uses.
    - The party popper can't be used if too many particles have been spawned. This can be disabled.
- Tweak the `Particle System` component to tweak the particle sprite, to limit how many particles the player can spawn, etc.
- Tweak the `Audio Source` component to change the audio clip, audio falloff, etc.
- You get the idea! ðŸ˜‰
